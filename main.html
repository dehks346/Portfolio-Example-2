            <p class="left-p">
                Hello, my name is <b>Henry</b>. I was born and live in the <b>South of England</b>. I've always liked computers, first using a old laptop when i was young to getting my <b>first computer in 2019</b>, ever since i owned one i have always been interested in coding and eventually i started learning! I also listen to <b>a lot</b> of music some of my favourite artists are Arctic Monkeys, Joey Bada$$, Tyler the creator and Oliver tree, if your interested my spotify is at the bottom of the page! I also enjoy movies and tv shows, in the past year or so i've begun to watch more horror/dark/gritty movies like NightCrawler/Prisoners/Zodiac, its not all dark stuff though i've watched animes like Hunter x Hunter and One Punch man!

        <h3 class="left-h3">studying ðŸŒŒ</h3>
        <p class="left-p">
            I'm Currently doing GCSE <b>Computer Science</b> and plan to continue studying Computer Science in the foreseeable future. I'm a mostly self taught coder, i'm familiar with <b>HTML</b> (2-3 Months), <b>CSS</b> (2-3 Months), <b>JavaScript</b> (1-2 Months), <b>Python</b> (2 Years), <b>C#</b> (1 year). I plan on working with JavaScript frameworks soon like React and Angular but haven't attempted anything yet, i will make sure to update the site once i have. If your looking to learn any new languages or even your first language i will always recommend <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/"><b>freeCodeCamp</b></a>, interative learning is my favourite but i equally recommend to start projects, remember to keep it reasonable, and learn as you go along using resources like <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/"><b>Stack Overflow</b></a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/"><b>Reddit</b></a>
        </p>

        <h3 class="left-h3">Work ðŸ˜Ž</h3>
            <p class="left-p">
                On my GitHub profile you can find <b>most</b> of my projects. if you check the read-me.md you can find the licensing, if allowed you can freely use any of my templates! i will most likely be updating it with a new project bi-weekly, the projects will vary. I plan on working on mostly front-end web development but i'm glad and happy to try new things, so you will occasionally find a different type of project on my GitHub such as a C# Game or maybe a Python application.
